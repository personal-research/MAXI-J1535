figure one: time vs net count rate plots for both (done)
figure two: energy/timing data and models for both sources (almost done)
figure three: HIDs for GRS (fix)
figure four: violin plots (need to fix, add MAXI)
figure five: pds with overplotted models and models (for now just GRS, may stay that way for space)
figure six: results regression plots (3x5: grs, maxi spectrum, maxi features five columns for five models; MAKE FONT SCALE BIGGER!)
figure seven: confusion matrix / ROC Plots (2x4: make top row ROCs, bottom confusion matrices, order is RF-Log-RF-Log for spec-spec-feature-feature; INCREASE FONT SCALE A LOT!)
figure eight: GRS feature importances
figure nine: MAXI feture importances (2x2: left two for spectrum, right two for features, top two for reg, bottom two for class)
figure ten: MAXI pairplot of all features (eh?)
figure eleven: bias investigation plots (2x2: left is some visual communication of differences in accuracy for freqs vs others, right is difference in accuracy plots when the model is forced to only focus on that one feature, e.g. maybe two side by side 2d histograms or kdes or scatter plots with kdes, experiment which looks best, but left is x=errors for spec general, y=errors for spec specialized, right is x=errors for features general, y = errors for features specialized. Has three plots for freqs, widths, and amplitudes)
