    "* One of the issues I noticed with the previous regression model when I was testing on QPO frequencies was although it could predict Frequencies for true QPOs well, the network was very bad at predicting 0 as the frequency for \"qpos\" that don't exist, i.e. it would predict 0.6 for the frequency of a third qpo when that pds only had two qpos. See this plot: \r\n",

    "* My proposed solution is this: combine the classification model I designed in ```interim.ipynb``` with the regression model I designed in ```exploring_regression_architectures.ipynb```. Since the classification model could predict (with ~85% accuracy) the number of QPOs, what if I make the model predict the number of QPOs first, and then automatically return 0s for outputs of the \"buffer\" qpos. For example, if the model predicts that there is only one qpo, it will only run regression for one frequency and return the frequency array ```[freq, 0, 0]``` rather than attempting to fit something weird for those second two frequencies when they should be zero. \r\n",
