| MAXI_J1543-564  | tbabs: 1.4 or 0.9   | "The increased foreground absorption leads to a slightly enlarged inner disc radius and to a slightly reduced inner disc temperature"; their results were consistent within errors, so we'll choose one  | https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.422..679S/abstract    |
