    "* In this model I will use knn for prediction of class and neural net for regression. It makes sense that the KNN is accurate for even k=1 because the points are temporally related so the most similiar point will be the closest in time and will thus share the most QPO properties. \n",
    "* I will conduct this test with an interated random selection of parameters (without replacement). \n",
    "* minibatch = 1 $<$ batch $<$ number of samples\n",
    "* Things to vary: batch size {4, 8, 16, 32}; learning rate {0.1, 0.01, 0.001}; number of layers {1, 2}; neurons per layer {4, 8, 12, 16}, number of epochs {500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000}\n",
    "* Something to consider instead of varrying the number of epochs: early stopping"
