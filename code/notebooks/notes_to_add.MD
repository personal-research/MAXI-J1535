## Other Ideas
* Good link for (Multi-Output Regression)[https://machinelearningmastery.com/multi-output-regression-models-with-python/]
* I think the idea of moving away from neural networks is also good because the sample is so incredibly small. 
* Some simplier regression machine learning algorithms that support multiple outputs directly: 
    * LinearRegression (an related such as RidgeRegression and LASSORegression)
    * DecisionTreeRegressor
    * RandomForestRegressor (and related)
* Another good idea is to train multiple iterations of the same model and average their predictions (I did this in my most recent version of the neural network-knn ensemble...the variance was really bad tho haha).
