## Dated Thoughts

    * Note how the SN20 paper doesn't have error bars on their time vs gamma/tin/etc. plot 
    * I am allowed to submit work from published papers to Regeron STS! 
    * I would like to include a plot of MAXI J1535-371 itself...I downloaded a couple images from the [MAXI website](http://maxi.riken.jp/mxondem/), we'll see if they have high enough resolution. 

## Before Dating

* This plot seems interesting, relevant, and informative:

* Is the plot in this paper an appropriate way to show maximum accuracy: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07167.pdf
* This is the one with the grid search plot: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10503.pdf
