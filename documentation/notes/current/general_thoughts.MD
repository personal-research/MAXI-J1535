# General Thoughts

## Dated Thoughts

* 1/16/2022
    * Should probably read this before writing about the machine learning (general classes of machine learning): [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/)
        * Remember the difference between discriminative and generative models
    * Extremely helpful article about three different ways to calculate feature importances with XGBOOST (and can be applied to Random Forest as well): [link](https://mljar.com/blog/feature-importance-xgboost/)
        * Should probably read this sklearn article about F-test vs permutation based importances (as explored with a random forest model) as well: [link](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/ensemble/plot_forest_importances.html)

    * Typing ```"\\wsl$``` in the address bar of

    * Machine learning mastery article on Histogram Gradient Boosting: [link](https://machinelearningmastery.com/histogram-based-gradient-boosting-ensembles/)

    * Note how the SN20 paper doesn't have error bars on their time vs gamma/tin/etc. plot 
    * I am allowed to submit work from published papers to Regeron STS! 
    * I would like to include a plot of MAXI J1535-371 itself...I downloaded a couple images from the [MAXI website](http://maxi.riken.jp/mxondem/), we'll see if they have high enough resolution. 

## Before Dating
* It seems that we would be innovating with this work as a quick search on ADS reveals no similiar works have been published(?):

* This plot seems interesting, relevant, and informative:  
![hyper parameter dist](images/hyperparameter_dist.png)
* Is the plot in this paper an appropriate way to show maximum accuracy: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.07167.pdf
* This is the one with the grid search plot: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.10503.pdf
