## Notes

### Astrophysics

### Machine Learning

* [Applied Predictive Modeling, 2013](http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/)
    * "â€¦ missing data can be imputed. In this case, we can use information in the training set predictors to, in essence, estimate the values of other predictors."
        * JBL says you can use "A constant value that has meaning within the domain, such as 0, distinct from all other values, a value from another randomly selected record; a mean, median or mode value for the column; a value estimated by another predictive model."
        
* [Feature Engineering and Selection, 2019](https://machinelearningmastery.com/handle-missing-data-python/)
    * "Many popular predictive models such as support vector machines, the glmnet, and neural networks, cannot tolerate any amount of missing values."
    * "Missing values are common occurrences in data. Unfortunately, most predictive modeling techniques cannot handle any missing values. Therefore, this problem must be addressed prior to modeling."
    * "When a predictor is discrete in nature, missingness can be directly encoded into the predictor as if it were a naturally occurring category."
    * "The simplest approach for dealing with missing values is to remove entire predictor(s) and/or sample(s) that contain missing values."
